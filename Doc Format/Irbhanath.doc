Irbhanath
Irbhanath (Bengali: ইরভানাথ) is a regional folk deity venerated primarily in Deuli village, located in Bagmundi, Purulia district, West Bengal, India. Worshipped predominantly by tribal and rural communities, Irbhanath is believed to be a localized transformation of a Jain Tirthankara, whose original identity evolved through centuries of cultural shifts, oral transmission, and religious syncretism.
Etymology and Name Evolution
The name Irbhanath is believed to be a corrupted or folk-evolved version of Arnath, a name recorded by 19th-century colonial explorer J.D. Beglar during his survey of the region. Later in the 20th century, David McCutchion, a renowned historian and researcher of Bengal temple architecture, found the same idol being referred to as Irbhanath. This shift in nomenclature reflects oral linguistic transformations over time, especially in communities with strong spoken traditions and minimal written records.
Historical Background
Early Jain Influence
The region now known as Rarh Bengal, comprising Purulia, Bankura, and parts of Bardhaman, was historically significant in the spread of Jainism, particularly during the period between the 2nd and 4th century BCE. It is believed that Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankara, traveled through this area during his missionary journeys.
Numerous ruins of Jain temples, statues, and monasteries (chaityas) have been discovered throughout this region, indicating a once-thriving Jain religious and cultural presence.
Decline of Jainism and Religious Assimilation
As Brahmanical Hinduism gained dominance in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the medieval period, Jain temples in this region were gradually abandoned. Over time, the once-Jain deities and structures were absorbed into local Hindu folk traditions, often being reinterpreted and renamed.
This process gave rise to hybrid religious practices where formerly Jain symbols, idols, and rituals were syncretized into mainstream or tribal Hinduism.
The Deuli Temples
The Irbhanath idol is located in a north-facing temple in Deuli, part of a larger cluster of five temples, originally observed by J.D. Beglar in the early 1870s. According to his survey:
The central temple faced north.


Two of the temples were already in a ruined condition by the 19th century.


The surviving temples, including the one housing Irbhanath, were actively used for local worship.


Beglar noted the presence of a three-foot black stone idol placed on a pedestal with a carving of a deer—a symbol common in Jain iconography.
David McCutchion's Observations
Approximately a century later, David McCutchion revisited the site. He documented:
The same black stone idol, bearing resemblance to Jain Tirthankaras.


Continued worship by a tribal Hindu priest, of lower caste lineage.


A deity now called Irbhanath instead of Arnath.


Continued belief and rituals by the local population associating the deity with fertility and childbirth.


McCutchion also confirmed the earlier-noted deer symbol, strengthening the hypothesis of Jain origins.
Iconography
The idol of Irbhanath is carved from a dark stone, not typical of standard schist or granite, and stands approximately three feet in height.
Key features include:
A deer symbol on the pedestal — common in Jain art, often associated with Tirthankaras.


A detached secondary idol with four arms, holding a sword, mace, ankusha (elephant goad), and scimitar, positioned under a kusum tree near the temple.


This idol had a broken nose, indicating damage over time or iconoclastic activity.


Worship and Rituals
Devotees and Beliefs
Irbhanath is particularly revered by women seeking fertility, especially those facing difficulties in conceiving. Worship is most fervent during the time of Jaishtha Sankranti, a seasonal Bengali festival.
Ritual Practices
Bathing Ritual: On the eve of Jaishtha Sankranti, women bathe in a local pond.


Divinatory Stone Ritual: If a stone is found in the hand during the bath, it is believed the woman will give birth to a male child. Other objects signify female offspring.


Manat: Devotees then visit the Irbhanath temple to offer a vow (manat) and perform ritual worship with the help of the temple priest.


Animal Sacrifice: Despite the idol's Jain origins, goat sacrifices are now a part of the worship tradition, reflecting the deep assimilation into Hindu folk rituals.


Annual Fair: A mela (fair) is organized on the day of Sankranti, attracting thousands of worshippers.


Interpretation and Scholarly Views
Scholars like McCutchion and other researchers affiliated with the K.P. Jaiswal Research Institute argue that Irbhanath represents a rare example of religious palimpsest—where a Jain Tirthankara has been transformed through centuries of folk reinterpretation into a Hindu fertility deity.
This transformation is indicative of:
The fluidity of religious identity in pre-modern and rural India.


The syncretism between tribal, folk, and organized religious traditions.


The linguistic evolution that reshaped the name Arnath → Irbhanath.


Cultural Significance
Irbhanath is a symbol of:
Survival of Jain heritage in remote Bengal.
Oral cultural transmission and name morphing.
Feminine agency in ritual spaces, as fertility-seeking women become central to the worship.
