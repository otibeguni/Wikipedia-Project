Nakti Thakarani
Nakti Thakarani (Bengali: নাকটি ঠাকরাণ) is a folk deity worshiped primarily in parts of Bengal, particularly around the Ishnath region and Purbasthali. The deity is distinguished by a unique iconographic feature—a missing or cut nose—which plays a central role in her associated legends and local cult practices. Often considered a regional goddess with both benevolent and fearsome attributes, Nakti Thakarani occupies a complex position in Bengali folk religion, blending elements of royal symbolism and folk myth.

Iconography and Description
The idol of Nakti Thakarani is typically depicted as a quadrilateral (chaturbhuj) figure with four arms, seated majestically on an elephant. She carries traditional divine weapons and symbols in her hands: the trident (trishula), mace (gada), elephant goad (ankush), and sword (khadga). A distinguishing and defining physical trait is her cut or missing nose, which has led to her name—Nakti meaning “cut nose,” and Thakarani referring to a revered woman or goddess figure.
Her royal regalia and the elephant mount symbolically connect her to the Vedic god Indra, whose divine vehicle is the elephant Airavata. The visual similarities between Nakti Thakarani and depictions of Indra suggest a syncretism of folk and classical Hindu religious iconography.

Mythological Origins and Local Legends
Local folklore holds that Nakti Thakarani was originally the wife of Ishnath, a regional deity or figure of worship. According to the prevalent narrative, after a domestic dispute, Ishnath’s wife decided to leave home. In a desperate act to prevent her departure, Ishnath cut off her nose, an act of mutilation that marked her both physically and symbolically.
This tragic episode is said to be the origin of the noseless idol and the deity’s name. The story reflects themes of conflict, sacrifice, and transformation typical in folk religious narratives, and also ties Nakti Thakarani’s worship to deep emotional and cultural undercurrents in the region.

Cult and Worship Practices
Historically, Nakti Thakarani was venerated in open-air shrines, especially under Kusum trees (Schleichera oleosa), a common sacred spot for folk deities in Bengal. A notable site was near Ishnath’s cremation ground, where a quadrangular idol was placed under such a tree.
In Purbasthali, a large banyan tree served as her thana (abode or sanctuary), and a bamboo structure was erected on the tree’s trunk for worship. Adjacent to this shrine was a pond, locally known as Nakti Pokur (Nakti pond), with knee-deep water where villagers have reported sightings of a mysterious black, curly-haired woman fishing at night. This apparition is widely believed by locals to be Nakti Thakarani herself manifesting in human form.
The worship of Nakti Thakarani involved offerings and rituals tied to agrarian cycles and local social life. However, with modernization and changing religious practices, her cult has largely become extinct, and the physical shrines have vanished.

Nakti Thakarani and Nakakati: Two Related Figures
A closely related figure in local lore is Nakakati, another “cut-nose” entity, who is characterized as an opadevatā—a malevolent or evil deity. Unlike Nakti Thakarani, Nakakati was not regarded as a goddess but as an evil spirit or demoness, whose worship is now completely lost.
Nakakati was also worshiped under a banyan tree and near the same pond, with her cult centered on fear and propitiation rather than devotion. This duality between Nakti Thakarani (more royal and divine) and Nakakati (malevolent spirit) illustrates the nuanced spectrum of folk deities in Bengal, where the boundaries between gods, goddesses, and spirits are fluid.

Possible Identification with Surpanakha
Scholars and folklore enthusiasts have noted parallels between Nakti Thakarani and Surpanakha from the Hindu epic Ramayana. Surpanakha is famously known for her mutilated nose and demoness status. Like Surpanakha, Nakti Thakarani occupies a liminal space between divinity and demonic power.
In Hindu ritualistic traditions, especially in tarpana (ritual offerings to spirits), demons are sometimes regarded as opadevatās, indicating that the worship of Nakti Thakarani or Nakakati might be a folk survival of ancient rites associated with appeasing supernatural forces symbolized by figures like Surpanakha.

Cultural Significance and Legacy
Nakti Thakarani’s cult reflects a rich tapestry of Bengali folk religion where mythology, social history, and ritual merge. Her story echoes themes of power, gender dynamics, and transformation, embodying the region’s unique synthesis of classical Hindu elements and indigenous beliefs.
Though her worship has faded, the tales and remnants of her shrines remain a vital part of Bengal’s intangible cultural heritage. The mysterious black woman seen fishing in Nakti pond symbolizes the enduring, haunting presence of folk deities in the everyday landscape.
