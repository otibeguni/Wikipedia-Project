= Irbhanath =

'''Irbhanath''' (Bengali: ইরভানাথ) is a regional folk deity venerated primarily in Deuli village, located in Bagmundi, Purulia district, West Bengal, India. Worshipped predominantly by tribal and rural communities, Irbhanath is believed to be a localized transformation of a Jain Tirthankara, whose original identity evolved through centuries of cultural shifts, oral transmission, and religious syncretism.<ref>McCutchion, David J. (1972). ''Late Medieval Temples of Bengal: Origin and Classification''. Calcutta: Firma KLM. ISBN 978-8120810660.</ref><ref>Sengupta, Nitish K. (2008). ''History of Jainism in Bengal''. ''Indian Historical Review''.</ref>

== Etymology and Name Evolution ==

The name Irbhanath is believed to be a corrupted or folk-evolved version of ''Arnath,'' a name recorded by 19th-century colonial explorer J.D. Beglar during his survey of the region.<ref>Beglar, J.D. (1872–73). ''Report of a Tour in the District of Purulia and Bankura''. Archaeological Survey of India Reports.</ref> In the 20th century, David McCutchion documented the same idol being referred to as Irbhanath, reflecting linguistic shifts in oral traditions.<ref>McCutchion, David J. (1972). ''Late Medieval Temples of Bengal: Origin and Classification''. Calcutta: Firma KLM.</ref>

== Historical Background ==

=== Early Jain Influence ===

The region of Rarh Bengal (covering Purulia, Bankura, and parts of Bardhaman) was historically significant in the spread of Jainism between the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. Jain texts suggest that Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, may have traveled through this region.<ref>Sen, Tansen (2008). ''Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism: Interaction and Syncretism in South Asia''. Oxford University Press.</ref> Archaeological finds, including Jain temples, chaityas, and sculptures, support the theory of a once-thriving Jain presence in this area.<ref>Ghosh, Amalananda (1989). ''An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology''. New Delhi: BR Publishing.</ref>

=== Decline and Religious Assimilation ===

With the gradual rise of Brahmanical Hinduism in the medieval period, Jainism declined in Bengal. Abandoned Jain temples and idols were absorbed into local Hindu and tribal religious practices, often renamed and reinterpreted as local deities.<ref>Roy, R.K. (1995). ''Tribal Religion and Folk Beliefs of Bengal''. ''Journal of Folklore Research''.</ref><ref>Sen, Tansen (2008). ''Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism: Interaction and Syncretism in South Asia''. Oxford University Press.</ref>

== The Deuli Temples ==

The Irbhanath idol is housed in a north-facing temple in Deuli, part of a cluster of five temples documented by J.D. Beglar in the 1870s.<ref>Beglar, J.D. (1872–73). ''Report of a Tour in the District of Purulia and Bankura''. Archaeological Survey of India Reports.</ref> He noted:

* The central temple faced north.
* Two temples were in ruins.
* The black stone idol featured a deer motif, common in Jain iconography.

=== David McCutchion's Observations ===

David McCutchion revisited the site in the 20th century and confirmed:

* The deer symbol was intact, reinforcing Jain origins.
* Worship was conducted by a tribal priest.
* The idol was renamed Irbhanath and venerated as a fertility deity.<ref>McCutchion, David J. (1972). ''Late Medieval Temples of Bengal: Origin and Classification''. Calcutta: Firma KLM.</ref>

== Iconography ==

The Irbhanath idol stands about three feet high, carved from dark stone. Features include:

* A deer on the pedestal — a Jain symbol.
* A separate four-armed idol beneath a kusum tree, bearing weapons (sword, mace, ankusha, scimitar), possibly indicating assimilation with Hindu deities.<ref>Settar, S., & Naidu, S. K. (Eds.) (2016). ''Jainism: Art, Architecture, and Philosophy''. Indian Council for Cultural Relations.</ref>

== Worship and Rituals ==

=== Devotional Practices ===

Irbhanath is primarily worshipped by women for fertility, especially during the festival of Jaishtha Sankranti.<ref>Chorkoborti, Mriganko. ''Banglar Debota Opodebota o Lokodebota''. [Publisher unknown], [n.d.].</ref>

=== Rituals Include: ===

* '''Bathing Ritual:''' Women bathe in a nearby pond the night before Jaishtha Sankranti.
* '''Divination:''' Stones or other objects found in hand during the bath symbolize the gender of future offspring.
* '''Vow (Manat):''' Offerings and prayers are made at the temple.
* '''Animal Sacrifice:''' Goat sacrifices, now part of worship, reflect syncretism with local Hindu traditions.
* '''Annual Fair:''' A mela is held during Sankranti, drawing large crowds.<ref>Roy, R.K. (1995). ''Tribal Religion and Folk Beliefs of Bengal''. ''Journal of Folklore Research''.</ref>

== Scholarly Interpretation ==

Scholars see Irbhanath as a rare religious palimpsest—a Jain Tirthankara reshaped into a Hindu folk god through centuries of oral reinterpretation. This transformation illustrates:

* Fluid religious identities in Bengal.
* Cultural layering of tribal, Jain, and Hindu traditions.
* Linguistic evolution (Arnath → Irbhanath).<ref>Sengupta, Nitish K. (2008). ''History of Jainism in Bengal''. ''Indian Historical Review''.</ref>

== Cultural Significance ==

Irbhanath symbolizes:

* Endurance of Jain heritage in rural Bengal.
* Syncretic religious practices.
* The role of women in preserving local religious traditions.
