== Buri (Folk Deity) ==

'''Buri''' (Bengali: বুড়ি) refers to a diverse class of ancient regional mother goddesses venerated across parts of eastern India, especially in West Bengal and Jharkhand. The term "Buri" does not denote an elderly woman, but rather symbolizes an ancestral, matriarchal, protective deity rooted in pre-Vedic, tribal, and agrarian traditions. These goddesses are deeply associated with fertility, health, prosperity, and village safety.

== Geographic Distribution ==
Buri worship is predominantly found in the districts of Bardhaman, Birbhum, Bankura, and Purulia in West Bengal, as well as regions in Jharkhand including Dhanbad and Dumka. Their shrines—called "Buri'r Thaan"—are often found in village outskirts, near rivers, fields, or sacred groves, reinforcing the goddesses' connection to nature and local ecology.

== Iconography and Worship Practices ==
Most Buri shrines lack anthropomorphic images or statues. Instead, a square-shaped cemented altar, a mound of earth, or a simple unshaped stone slab is venerated as the goddess. These spaces are considered sacred and are sometimes shaded by trees. Worshippers often engage in symbolic offerings and devotional acts that blend animist and Hindu elements.

=== Votive Offerings and Ritual Objects ===
A central feature of Buri worship is the offering of terracotta horses and elephants—symbolizing vehicles for the deity. These are especially presented upon fulfillment of vows (''manat''). Over time, they accumulate into striking mounds around the shrine. Additional offerings may include alcohol (as in the case of Bidh Buri), animal sacrifices (such as goats), and rice-based foods. In many cases, only males are permitted to consume the ''prasad'', and it must be eaten standing at the shrine.

== Notable Shrines and Associated Deities ==

=== Bidh Buri (Khayarbari, Bardhaman) ===
Named after her location near a dam (''bidh''), Bidh Buri's shrine is an enclosed marble structure where terracotta horses are offered. Alcohol is an essential ritual component. Only boys may consume the ''prasad'', and only while standing on-site.

=== Sitaiburi (Amanala village, Bardhaman) ===
This shrine contains terracotta horses of various sizes. Sitaiburi is petitioned especially by parents for the health of children.

=== Ahar Buri (Banshul, between Durgapur and Bankura) ===
Known as the provider of food and nourishment, Ahar Buri is worshipped particularly for children who are ill or unable to eat. Terracotta elephants and horses are her primary offerings.

=== Panuria Buri (Panuria village, Bardhaman) ===
A popular shrine where locals leave terracotta horses in return for fulfilled vows, reflecting a strong link between faith and agricultural fertility.

=== Chitura Buri (Rangamati, Bankura) ===
This shrine contains circular stone pieces and terracotta horse idols. Chitura Buri is linked with rustic fertility rituals.

=== Additional Shrines ===

Bishram Buri (Parbatpur, Bardhaman): Possibly linked to rest or healing.

Bhootaburi (Samdihi, Bardhaman): Possibly associated with spirits (''bhoot'').

Barali Buri (Bankura): Little-documented, but involved in vow-based worship.

Nuni Buri (Dhadka, Asansol): Minimal data, yet horse offerings continue.

Juri Buri (Juri Dangal, Jharkhand): A myth surrounds a broken sword and a sacred river.

Kisha Buri (Karothan Karo, Jharkhand): Known for a myth involving magically appearing utensils.

Malanch Buri (Kebaljuri, Jharkhand): Said to have relocated her own shrine miraculously.

== Ritual Legends and Folklore ==

=== Juri Buri ===
Worshipped on the banks of the Ajay River, her legend tells of a priest who accidentally dropped a sacrificial sword into a sacred pit where the gods had gathered. The goddess, angered by the disruption, broke the sword’s tip and forbade further ritual presence. From then on, sacrifices continued using the same broken-tipped blade—a tradition still maintained today.

=== Kisha Buri ===
This goddess once granted household utensils miraculously to those in need. After a devotee misused her generosity by not returning the items, she withdrew her blessings. Believers say that no utensils have appeared since, despite repeated prayers.

=== Malanch Buri ===
Originally worshipped atop a hill, her shrine was relocated by divine will to its present location at the foothill, after her devotee—a pregnant priest's wife—was no longer able to climb. This act of compassion made her especially beloved. Her priesthood continues among the Laya subgroup of the Mal community.

== Child-Protecting Buris ==

Kidaneya Buri (Sanbidha, Bankura): Worshipped to pacify constantly crying children.

Paisey Buri (Rangamati, Bankura): Honored by midwives during postnatal rituals, especially on the fifth day after childbirth.

== Cultural Significance ==
The Buri deities form a crucial component of local spiritual life in rural Bengal and Jharkhand. They represent a fusion of tribal animism, feminine power, and folk Hinduism. Their shrines are not merely religious spaces but community centers for health, fertility, weather control, agriculture, and kinship rites. Their worship also highlights the persistence of matriarchal spiritual paradigms in a predominantly patriarchal religious landscape.

The Buri goddesses are typically localized and do not feature in pan-Indian Hindu texts or mainstream temple worship. This decentralization underscores the intensely personal and site-specific character of Bengali folk religion.
